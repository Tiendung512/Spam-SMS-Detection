# Spam-SMS-Detection

Our project consists of several comprehensive steps, starting from data pre-processing and comparing the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms to choose the most efficient model. 

Our goal is to select a model that can accurately distinguish between spam and ham messages, and then embed this model into a user-friendly website.

With our website, users will be able to easily and reliably determine whether a message is spam or not.
